# What is Event Sourcing

Event Sourcing is a system where the source of truth is events. In other words
it is possible to reconstruct the entire application state from a table
containing all the changes to the state. This table is called an event store.

# Do you need microservices?

Not really but it works nicely together.

# Do you need CQRS?

Again no, but it makes sense that the service that writes events to the
event store is different from the service that materialises a view that can be
queried.

# What language do I want to write services in?

Since I want to do functional programming there are some languages that are
better than others for functional programming.

## Reasonml

Reasonml has great support for functional programming, while having an OOP like
syntax. I havenâ€™t seen any examples of it being used to create a web service
so the ecosystem might not be well served for that purpose but I will have to
look into that further.

## Node

Node is pretty good for microservices, and the tooling for serverless functions
is very good.

Both javascript and typescript can do some functional programming. There are
features that are missing compared to languages like Haskell and reasonml. For
instance js & ts does not have pattern matching or typeclasses.

# How to deal with errors and response-codes

When doing Event Sourcing there is an asynchronous nature to most commands and 
the web service might have to wait for another event to be dispatched from 
another service before knowing whether a command has succeeded. Finding a good 
way to manage that in the context of synchronous http call can be tricky and i 
don't yet know how to do that.
