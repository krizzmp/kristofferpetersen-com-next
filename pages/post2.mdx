During this sprint I created two versions of a frontend for signing up for 
memberships. Iâ€™ve used two different methods for state management, 
namely MobX and useGlobalState. For the use case I was looking at MobX turned 
out to have worked much better.

I am also in the process of creating a backend in Kotlin. I decided that I 
wanted to tryout following Clean Architecture by Uncle Bob. My plan is to see 
how that architecture works, then add CQRS, and finally add on Event Sourcing.

My reasoning is that starting from a good but familiar architecture will give 
me a good foundation to both compare the different approaches, but also means 
that when I add on new parts of the architecture the code will still follow 
principles of good software.
